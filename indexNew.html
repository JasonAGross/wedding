    	<h1>A question, a party, and a number</h1>
    	<p>Their story begins with a circle of friends.</p>
    	<p>As if their lives were meant to come together, Alicia and Jason shared several pairs of mutual friends in Indianapolis. It was to those friends that Jason posed a rather simple question. "Alicia, is she single?"</p>
    	<p>Surprisingly enough, the answer was yes, and so a formula was conceived to spend a little more time as a group and to make sure Alicia was invited, even encouraged, to come along. A pool party was soon proposed while the weather played along nicely. Not one to watch opportunity go by, Jason wasted no time prompting Alicia for some info.</p>
    	<p>Alicia played hard to get thoughout the day but persistence proved to pay off as the end of the evening resulted in her sharing her phone number with the nagging Jason.</p>
