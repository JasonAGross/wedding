        	<h1>A question, a party, and a number</h1>
        	<p>Their story begins with a circle of friends.</p>
        	<p>As if their lives were meant to come together, Alicia and Jason shared several pairs of mutual friends in Indianapolis. It was to those friends that Jason posed a rather simple question. "Alicia, is she single?"</p>
        	<p>Surprisingly enough, the answer was yes, and so a formula was conceived to spend a little more time as a group and to make sure Alicia was invited, even encouraged, to come along. A pool party was soon proposed while the weather played along nicely. Not one to watch opportunity go by, Jason wasted no time prompting Alicia for some info.</p>
        	<p>Alicia played hard to get thoughout the day but persistence proved to pay off as the end of the evening resulted in her sharing her phone number with the nagging Jason.</p>

            <h1>Beginnings</h1>
            <p>Shortly after a first date was arranged, a casual get together for drinks at Ale Emporium. The two hit it off, learning about their unique and shared interests. Alicia had the only beers she has ever enjoyed in her life. Something must have gone right in that first evening, because since then not a single day has passed without Alicia and Jason checking in on each other.</p>
            <p>Over the coming weeks more dates followed around Indianapolis, dinners, walks, desserts, and shows. The two grew close and after yet more persistence from Jason, agreed to become a couple in late July. </p>

            <h1>A New Journey Together</h1>
            <p>Just several months later Aliciaâ€™s love for travel had made its impact. The two were off on an excursion though Northern Arizona, hiking the branches of the Grand Canyon and sleeping along spring fed creeks on the canyon floor. </p>
            <p>Travel became a spark for the couple. Planning trips, solving problems, and experiencing the wonder the world has to offer together has become a staple of their relationship. Since that first trip in their young relationship, Alicia and Jason have visited Costa Rica, New England and Acadia, the Smokey Mountains, the Florida Shoreline, Olympic National Park, and Mount Rainier. </p>

            <h1>A Proposal</h1>
            <p>From the Grand Canyon to Mount Rainier was a trip that neither could have predicted. Every trip and every relaxing weekend at home in between brought the two closer together. Unwilling to wait any longer to ask a question that he knew he would ask long ago, Jason bought a ring and tucked it away in a carry-on bag for the best trip of them yet.</p>
            <p>In a meadow, with valleys below and the peak of Mount Rainier above, Jason asked Alicia if he could be by her side and experience this life together forever. Alicia kindly accepted that offer, opening a new chapter if their lives.</p>
